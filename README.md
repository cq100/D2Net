## Remarks

1. When you only have one GPU, please comment out the Gradnorm code block
2. The pre-trained model is trained on a private data set. When you try to do other tasks, please retrain the model on a new data set
3. Please set the learning rate of the discriminator reasonably according to your task
4. In order to facilitate understanding, we simplified this code. If you have questions, please contact us in time
5. This code will continue to be updated
